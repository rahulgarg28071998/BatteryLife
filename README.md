# BatteryLife

Modern day smartphone batteries usually last for a Cycle Life in the range of 600-750 charging
cycles before the battery reaches its end of life (when the remaining capacity of the battery falls
down to 70-80% of the original capacity).
A Charging Cycle is equivalent to a complete discharge of a battery from a full to an empty state.
As the battery ages due to the repetitive usage over time, its capacity degrades resulting in
elapsing of the charging cycles till battery can no longer be used.
Battery Capacity basically represents the total charge that a battery can store during charging or
the total current that is capable of supplying during discharging. For instance, a brand new
3300mAh battery will discharge a current equivalent to 3300mA for 1 hour and can store a total
energy of 3300mAh when charged with 3300mA current for 1 hour.
To get an estimate of how old is the battery it is important to estimate the number of Charging
Cycles that could have been elapsed by the battery in problem, which can be done on the basis of
remaining capacity of the battery at any given point in time.
So, we are planning to:
> Compute Life cycle of a battery.
> Present charge holding capacity of the battery
